This is an iterative optimization algorithm that takes steps in the direction of the gradient of the loss function and then projects the resulting perturbation back onto a constrained space (e.g., an L-infinity ball). The `learning_rate` (or step size) for PGD is set here.\n",

    "    * `PONoisedSampleBounding`: This ensures that the pixel values of the *adversarial image* (original image + noise) remain within a valid range (e.g., 0 to 255 for standard images).\n",
    "* **Noise Generator**: `AdditiveNoiseGenerator` is used.\n",
    "    * `dist=\"zeros\"`: Initializes the noise with all zeros. The PGD optimizer will then iteratively modify this noise.\n",
    "    * `scale=[0, 255]`: Informs the generator about the typical range of the input data it will be added to. This is more relevant if a random distribution (like \"uniform\" or \"normal\") was used for `dist`. For `dist=\"zeros\"`, `PONoisedSampleBounding` is key.\n",
