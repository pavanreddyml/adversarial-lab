prompt = "A group of scientists aboard a futuristic research vessel in orbit around a newly discovered exoplanet detect a series of unnatural signals coming from deep beneath the planet's icy surface. The signals appear to follow a complex mathematical structure and exhibit characteristics of an ancient Earth language, suggesting either an advanced alien intelligence or a lost human civilization. As the team descends into the ice via a massive drilling rig, they uncover an underground ocean teeming with bio-luminescent organisms and remnants of a colossal structure built from unknown materials that defy modern physics. The expedition begins experiencing time distortions, with some members reporting days passing while others experience only minutes. One scientist uncovers a hidden chamber that contains a crystalline archive capable of interacting with human consciousness, revealing memories not their own — possibly from a parallel timeline or alternate Earth. As tensions rise aboard the vessel due to conflicting motivations — scientific discovery, corporate profit, and personal survival — the team must decide whether to activate the artifact fully, risking their own reality for answers to the universe's deepest questions. Meanwhile, a rival organization back on Earth prepares to seize control of the mission, forcing the team into a race against time, betrayal, and a force that may not be entirely alive — or entirely dead."
